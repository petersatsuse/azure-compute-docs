## NVads V710-series
To leverage the GPU capabilities of the new Azure NVads V710-series VMs running Linux, amdgpu drivers need to be installed. The [AMD GPU Driver Extension](../extensions/hpccompute-amd-gpu-linux) facilitates the installation of amdgpu drivers on NVv710-series VMs. You can manage the extension using the Azure portal, Azure PowerShell, or Azure Resource Manager templates. Refer to the [AMD GPU Driver Extension](articles/virtual-machines/extensions/hpccompute-amd-gpu-linux.md) documentation for details on supported operating systems and deployment steps.

If you prefer to install amdgpu drivers manually, this article outlines the supported operating systems, drivers, and provides installation and verification steps.

### ROCm
### 1. Installation Guide

#### 1.1 Introduction

Here are the steps for installing the AMD Linux Driver to harness the capabilities of the AMD Radeon&trade; PRO V710 GPU on an NVv5-V710 GPU Linux instance provided by Microsoft Azure. Subsequent sections provide detailed Linux driver installation instructions for users who wish to perform inference using ROCm on the NVv5-V710 GPU Linux instance.
> **Note:** This page outlines installation instructions for **Ubuntu**.  
> For any other Linux distributions, please refer to the official [AMD ROCm documentation](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/install-on-linux/en/docs-6.3.3/install/quick-start.html)
### 2. Linux Driver Installation
#### 2.1 Supported Linux Distros

Confirm the system has a supported Linux version.
To obtain the Linux distribution information, use the following command:
``` bash
$ cat /etc/*release
```
Output is similar to the following example
```bash
DISTRIB_ID=Ubuntu 
DISTRIB_RELEASE=XX 
DISTRIB_CODENAME=jammy 
DISTRIB_DESCRIPTION="Ubuntu" 
PRETTY_NAME="Ubuntu LTS"
```
Confirm that your Linux distribution matches a [supported distribution](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/install-on-linux/en/latest/reference/system-requirements.html#supported-distributions).

#### 2.2 Supported Linux Kernel

To check the kernel version of your Linux system, use the below command:
```bash
$ uname -srmv
```
Output is similar to the following example

```bash
Linux 5.XX.0-XX-generic #86-Ubuntu SMP Mon Jul 10 16:07:21 UTC 2023 x86_64
```
Confirm that your kernel version matches the [supported operating systems](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/install-on-linux/en/latest/reference/system-requirements.html#supported-distributions).

### 3. Prerequisites
>[!Note]
> The disk size must be greater than 64GB to ensure optimal performance and compatibility.
#### 3.1 Update the package list
To ensure you have the latest information on the newest versions of packages and their dependencies.
```bash
sudo apt update
```
#### 3.2 Install Python Setuptools and wheel
These are essential for building and distributing Python packages.
```bash
$ sudo apt install python3-setuptools python3-wheel
```

#### 3.3 Setting Permissions for groups

Add yourself to the render and video group using the following command:
```bash
$ sudo usermod -a -G render,video $LOGNAME
```

#### 3.4 Kernel headers and development packages

The driver package uses Dynamic Kernel Module Support (DKMS) to build the amdgpu-dkms module for installed kernels. This requires the installation of Linux kernel headers and modules for each kernel. These are installed automatically with the kernel. However, if you use multiple kernel versions or download kernel images without the meta-packages, you might need to install them manually.

```bash
$ sudo apt install "linux-headers-$(uname -r)" "linux-modules-extra-$(uname -r)"
```

#### 3.5 Verifying GPU Card in Linux&reg;

The output should the GPU card.

```Bash
$ sudo lspci -d 1002:7461
c3:00.0 Display controller: Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. [AMD/ATI] Device 7461
```

>[!NOTE]
> 7461 is the Virtual Function Device ID. This confirms that the Virtual Machine is configured with the AMD Radeon&trade; PRO V710 GPU.

#### 3.6 Virtual Machine Update

On an NVv5-V710 GPU Linux instance running Ubuntu 22.04 OS, run the update: 
```bash
$ sudo apt update
```

#### 3.7 Blacklist amdgpu Driver

Before installing the latest AMD Linux driver, it's important to **blacklist** the default amdgpu driver. The default driver, present in Linux distributions like Ubuntu or RHEL, is not certified for use with the **AMD Radeon™ PRO V710 GPU** on an **NVv5-V710 GPU Linux instance**. The driver optimized for Azure NVv5-V710 GPU workloads should be used instead.

##### Check if the Driver is Already Blacklisted

To check if the amdgpu driver is already blacklisted, run the following command:

```bash
grep amdgpu /etc/modprobe.d/* -rn
```
If the driver is blacklisted, you don't need to modify anything else. Be careful with entries that start with #blacklist amdgpu – this means the driver is not blacklisted


##### Blacklist the amdgpu Driver
To install the latest driver, you must blacklisted the default amdgpu driver. Follow these steps:

Open the /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf file to edit:
```bash 
sudo vim /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf
```

Add the following line to blacklist the amdgpu driver:
```bash
blacklist amdgpu
```

After updating the blacklist.conf file, run the following command to apply the changes:
```bash
$ sudo update-initramfs -uk all
```
This ensures the changes take effect and the driver is properly blacklisted.
#### 3.8 Reboot

After restarting the Virtual Machine, the default amdgpu driver in Ubuntu Linux distributions does not load because we blacklisted it. To confirm that the driver isn't loaded, run the command "lsmod | grep amdgpu" to check if the amdgpu driver is loaded. If there's no output, the driver isn't loaded, and you can proceed. However, if the driver has remained loaded, return to the previous step to double-check that the amdgpu driver has been blacklisted correctly.

### 4. AMD Driver Installation
#### 4.1 Installation

The following steps demonstrate the use of the amdgpu-install script for a single-version driver installation. To install the latest ROCm driver, run the following commands on your terminal:
<details>
  <summary><strong>Ubuntu 22.04</strong></summary>

  ```bash
  sudo apt update
sudo apt install "linux-headers-$(uname -r)" "linux-modules-extra-$(uname -r)"
sudo apt install python3-setuptools python3-wheel
sudo usermod -a -G render,video $LOGNAME # Add the current user to the render and video groups
wget https://repo.radeon.com/amdgpu-install/6.3.3/ubuntu/jammy/amdgpu-install_6.3.60303-1_all.deb
sudo apt install ./amdgpu-install_6.3.60303-1_all.deb
sudo apt update
sudo apt install amdgpu-dkms rocm
```
  </details> 
  <details>
  <summary><strong>Ubuntu 24.04</strong></summary>

  ```bash
  sudo apt update
sudo apt install "linux-headers-$(uname -r)" "linux-modules-extra-$(uname -r)"
sudo apt install python3-setuptools python3-wheel
sudo usermod -a -G render,video $LOGNAME # Add the current user to the render and video groups
wget https://repo.radeon.com/amdgpu-install/6.3.3/ubuntu/noble/amdgpu-install_6.3.60303-1_all.deb
sudo apt install ./amdgpu-install_6.3.60303-1_all.deb
sudo apt update
sudo apt install amdgpu-dkms rocm
```
  </details> 

>[!NOTE]
> If needed, this can be used to create a script to automate the installation process.

#### 4.2 Load amdgpu driver

```bash
$ sudo modprobe amdgpu
```

Review the output of **" dmesg | grep amdgpu "** to confirm that the GPU driver is loaded and initialized successfully.

```bash
$ sudo dmesg | grep amdgpu 
[ 66.177373] [drm] amdgpu kernel modesetting enabled. 
[ 66.177379] [drm] amdgpu version: 6.7.0

[ 66.689542] amdgpu 045b:00:00.0: amdgpu: CP RS64 enable
```

#### 4.3 Un-Blacklist the driver

To automatically load the `amdgpu` driver on every reboot of the VM, we need to remove any blacklist entry that is preventing it from loading automatically.
##### Search for the blacklist entry

Run the following command to find any file that contains `blacklist amdgpu`:

```bash
grep amdgpu /etc/modprobe.d/* -rn
```
If the driver is blacklisted, you will see output similar to:
```bash
/etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf:10:blacklist amdgpu
```
##### Remove the blacklist line
Open the file listed in the output:
```bash
sudo nano /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf
```
Delete the line that says:
```bash
blacklist amdgpu
```
Save and exit the file
##### Update initramfs
Update the initramfs so the changes are applied on the next boot:
```bash
sudo update-initramfs -uk all
```
##### Reboot the system
Reboot the machine to load the updated configuration:
```bash
sudo reboot
```
After rebooting, the `amdgpu` driver should no longer be blacklisted and will be available for use.

Run AMD-SMI to confirm the driver is loaded successfully 

```bash
$ amd-smi monitor
```
```bash

```
Please ensure your Linux distribution and kernel version are listed in the table above.  
>[!Note]
>Refer to the troubleshooting section at the end of the document for instructions on how to set the 
>6.5 kernel as the default (at every boot time) on the NvV5 V710 GPU instance. 

>[!Note]
>If you plan to run the graphics workload, use the Linux distribution with graphics enabled (e.g., Ubuntu-22.04-desktop-amd64.iso).
### 3. Troubleshooting
This section will outline troubleshooting techniques to address issues that may arise during the driver installation process.
If you are using the Kernel 6.8, follow the below steps to downgrade to kernel 6.5.

##### Check Loaded Kernels: 

Run the following command to list the loaded kernels
```bash
dpkg --list | egrep -i --color 'linux-image|linux-headers|linux-modules' | awk '{ print $2 }'
```
Review the output to see the currently loaded kernels.

##### Install Kernel 6.5: 

If Kernel 6.5 is not loaded, install it using
```bash
sudo apt install linux-image-6.5.0-1025-azure
```
##### Purge Kernels Above 6.5: 

Use the following command to purge kernels above version 6.5
```bash
sudo apt purge linux-headers-6.8.0-1025-azure linux-image-6.8.0-1025-azure linux-modules-6.8.0-1025-azure
```
##### Verify Kernel Version: 

Please verify that only Kernel 6.5 is present by running
```bash
dpkg --list | egrep -i --color 'linux-image|linux-headers|linux-modules' | awk '{ print $2 }'
```
The output should be similar to the following example:
```bash
linux-image-6.5.0-1025-azure
linux-headers-6.5.0-1025-azure
linux-modules-6.5.0-1025-azure
```
##### Modify GRUB Settings: 

Open the GRUB settings and change GRUB_DEFAULT="0" to GRUB_DEFAULT="Advanced options for Ubuntu>Ubuntu, with Linux 6.5.0-1025-azure"
```bash
GRUB_DEFAULT="Advanced options for Ubuntu>Ubuntu, with Linux 6.5.0-1025-azure"
```
##### Update GRUB and Reboot: 

Update GRUB and reboot the system using
```bash
sudo update-grub
sudo reboot
```
##### Validate Kernel Version: 

After rebooting, validate the kernel version using
```bash
uname -a
```
#### 3.1 Loading Kernel 6.5 by default on boot
When the NVv5-V710 GPU Linux instance is launched, the OS boots to the 6.8.0-1015-azure kernel instead of the 6.5.0-1025-azure kernel. The GRUB settings need to be modified to boot into the 6.5.0-1025-azure kernel.

to check the currently installed kernels, use the below command
```bash
$ dpkg --list | egrep -i --color 'linux-image' | awk '{ print $2 }'
```
Output is similar to the following example
```bash
Linux-image-6.5.0-1025-azure 
linux-image-6.8.0-1015-azure 
linux-image-azure
```

>[!Note]
>Follow the below section if 6.5 kernel doesn't exist, otherwise skip it

### 4. Prerequisites

### 6. x11 Remote Server Confirguration
After installing the AMD Graphics Linux drivers with , the default graphical interface (Xserver) does not 
utilize hardware acceleration. As a solution, a virtual display should be created with hardware 
acceleration enabled that can be used for remote access (x11vnc). The following steps will walk through 
the virtual display setup:
#### 6.1 Install Required Packages
Install `x11vnc` and `net-tools`
```bash
$ sudo apt install net-tools 
$ sudo apt install x11vnc 
```
#### 6.2 Update GDM3 Custom Configuration
Edit the GDM3 configuration file to:

   -Disable Wayland (which does not support x11vnc)

   -Enable automatic login (so a graphical session is available at boot)

Open the configuration file with:

```bash
$ sudo vim /etc/gdm3/custom.conf
```

After modification the file looks like this
```bash
# GDM configuration storage 
 
[daemon] 
AutomaticLoginEnable=true 
AutomaticLogin=amd 
 
# Uncomment the line below to force the login screen to use Xorg 
WaylandEnable=false 
 
# Enabling automatic login 
 
# Enabling timed login 
#  TimedLoginEnable = true 
#  TimedLogin = user1 
#  TimedLoginDelay = 10 
 
[security] 
 
[xdmcp] 
 
[chooser] 
 
[debug] 
# Uncomment the line below to turn on debugging 
# More verbose logs 
# Additionally lets the X server dump core if it crashes 
#Enable=true
```
#### 6.3 Reboot and Restart gdm3
After reboot restart the gdm3 by following command
```bash
$ sudo systemctl restart gdm3
```
#### 6.4 Modify X configuration
##### 6.4.1 Getting Bus ID
The BusID of the AMD Radeon™ PRO V710 GPU must be manually added to the X11 configuration file. 
To get the BusID, follow the steps below
```bash
$ lspci -d 1002: | awk '{print $1}' 
3a9e:00:00.0
```
>[!Note]
 Convert BusID of GPU from HEX to Decimal, e.g., "3a9e:00:00.0", convert HEX "3a9e00" into DEC "3841536" 
##### 6.4.2 Updating X Configuration to add Device and Screen
Furthermore, modify the “Screen” section to incorporate this device.

Modify /usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d/00-amdgpu.conf to match the content below

#### 6.5 Reboot

After installation, reboot the virtual machine to apply changes:

```bash
sudo reboot
```
#### 6.6 Load Driver
Once the system is back up, load the amdgpu driver using the following commands:
```bash
$ sudo systemctl stop gdm   
$ sudo modprobe amdgpu  
$ sudo systemctl start gdm 
```
> These commands temporarily stop and restart the GNOME Display Manager(gdm) to load the driver correctly. Make sure you save your work before running them
#### 6.7 Running x11vnc
To start the VNC server and automatically find the correct display and authentication, use the following command:
```bash
x11vnc --forever -find
```
This will search for the active X display and user credentials (XAUTH) automatically.

### Uninstallation Steps
If you need to uninstall the existing amdgpu driver, follow these steps:

Check DKMS status:
```bash
dkms status
```
Uninstall the amdgpu driver:
```bash
sudo amdgpu-install --uninstall
sudo amdgpu-uninstall
```
Remove the amdgpu installation package:
```bash
sudo apt autoremove --purge amdgpu-install
```
Reboot the system:
```bash
sudo reboot
```
Check DKMS status again to ensure the driver has been uninstalled:
```bash
dkms status
```
This ensures the old amdgpu driver is fully removed from the system before installing the new driver.
