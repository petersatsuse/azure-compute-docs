# Prepare a Red Hat-based virtual machine for Azure

**Applies to:** :heavy_check_mark: Linux VMs :heavy_check_mark: Flexible scale sets :heavy_check_mark: Uniform scale sets

In this article, you learn how to prepare a Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) virtual machine (VM) for use in Azure. The versions of RHEL that are covered in this article are 7.x, 8.X., 9.x. The hypervisors for preparation that are covered in this article are Hyper-V, kernel-based VM (KVM), VMware and Kickstart.

For more information about eligibility requirements for participating in Red Hat's Cloud Access program, see [the Red Hat Cloud Access website](https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/cloud-computing/cloud-access) and [Running RHEL on Azure](https://access.redhat.com/ecosystem/ccsp/microsoft-azure). For ways to automate building RHEL images, see [Azure Image Builder](../image-builder-overview.md).

> [!NOTE]
> Be aware of versions that are at their end of life (EOL) and are no longer supported by Red Hat. Uploaded images that are at or beyond EOL are supported on a reasonable business-effort basis. For more information, see the Red Hat [Product Life Cycles](https://access.redhat.com/product-life-cycles/?product=Red%20Hat%20Enterprise%20Linux,OpenShift%20Container%20Platform%204).

### Prerequisites

This section assumes that you've already obtained an ISO file from the Red Hat website and installed the RHEL image to a virtual hard disk (VHD). For more information about how to use Hyper-V Manager to install an operating system image, see [Install the Hyper-V role and configure a virtual machine](/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2012-R2-and-2012/hh846766(v=ws.11)).

### RHEL installation notes

* Azure doesn't support the VHDX format. Azure supports only *fixed VHD*. You can use Hyper-V Manager to convert the disk to VHD format, or you can use the `convert-vhd` cmdlet. If you use VirtualBox, select **Fixed size** as opposed to the default dynamically allocated option when you create the disk.
* Azure supports Gen1 (BIOS boot) and Gen2 (UEFI boot) VMs.
* The maximum size that's allowed for the VHD is 1,023 GB.
* The vfat kernel module must be enabled in the kernel.
* Logical Volume Manager (LVM) is supported and can be used on the OS disk or data disks in Azure VMs. In general, we recommend that you use standard partitions on the OS disk rather than LVM. This practice avoids LVM name conflicts with cloned VMs, particularly if you ever need to attach an operating system disk to another identical VM for troubleshooting. For more information, see the [LVM](/previous-versions/azure/virtual-machines/linux/configure-lvm) and [RAID](/previous-versions/azure/virtual-machines/linux/configure-raid) documentation.
* *Kernel support for mounting Universal Disk Format (UDF) file systems is required*. At first boot on Azure, the UDF-formatted media that's attached to the guest passes the provisioning configuration to the Linux VM. The Azure Linux agent must be able to mount the UDF file system to read its configuration and provision the VM. Without this step, provisioning fails.
* Don't configure a swap partition on the operating system disk. For more information, read the following steps.
* All VHDs on Azure must have a virtual size aligned to 1 MB. When you convert from a raw disk to VHD, you must ensure that the raw disk size is a multiple of 1 MB before conversion. For more information, read the following steps. See also [Linux installation notes](create-upload-generic.md#general-linux-installation-notes).

> [!NOTE]
> _Cloud-init >= 21.2 removes the UDF requirement_. However, without the UDF module enabled, the CD-ROM won't mount during provisioning, which prevents custom data from being applied. A workaround is to apply custom data by using user data. Unlike custom data, user data isn't encrypted. For more information, see [User data formats](https://cloudinit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/topics/format.html).




#### [RHEL 7 using Hyper-V Manager](#tab/rhel7hv)

1. In Hyper-V Manager, select the VM.

1. Select **Connect** to open a console window for the VM.

1. Create or edit the `/etc/sysconfig/network` file, and add the following text:

    ```config
    NETWORKING=yes
    HOSTNAME=localhost.localdomain
    ```

1. Create or edit the `/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0` file, and add the following text:

    ```config
    DEVICE=eth0
    ONBOOT=yes
    BOOTPROTO=dhcp
    TYPE=Ethernet
    USERCTL=no
    PEERDNS=yes
    IPV6INIT=no
    PERSISTENT_DHCLIENT=yes
    NM_CONTROLLED=yes
    ```

    > [!NOTE]
    > When you use Accelerated Networking, the synthetic interface that's created must be configured to be unmanaged by using a udev rule. This action prevents `NetworkManager` from assigning the same IP to it as the primary interface. <br>
    
    To apply it:<br>
    
    ```bash
    sudo tee <<EOF /etc/udev/rules.d/68-azure-sriov-nm-unmanaged.rules > /dev/null
    # Accelerated Networking on Azure exposes a new SRIOV interface to the VM.
    # This interface is transparently bonded to the synthetic interface,
    # so NetworkManager should just ignore any SRIOV interfaces.
    SUBSYSTEM=="net", DRIVERS=="hv_pci", ACTION!="remove", ENV{NM_UNMANAGED}="1"
    EOF
    ```
1. Ensure that the network service starts at boot time:

    ```bash
    sudo systemctl enable network
    ```

1. Register your Red Hat subscription to enable the installation of packages from the RHEL repository:

    ```bash
    sudo subscription-manager register --auto-attach --username=XXX --password=XXX
    ```

1. Modify the kernel boot line in your grub configuration to include more kernel parameters for Azure. To do this modification, open `/etc/default/grub` in a text editor and edit the `GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX` parameter. For example:

    ```config-grub
    GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX="console=tty1 console=ttyS0,115200n8 earlyprintk=ttyS0 net.ifnames=0"
    GRUB_TERMINAL_OUTPUT="serial console"
    GRUB_SERIAL_COMMAND="serial --speed=115200 --unit=0 --word=8 --parity=no --stop=1"
    ENABLE_BLSCFG=true
    ```

   > [!NOTE]
   > If [ENABLE_BLSCFG=false](https://access.redhat.com/solutions/6929571) is present in `/etc/default/grub` instead of `ENABLE_BLSCFG=true`, tools such as *grubedit* or *gubby*, which rely on the Boot Loader Specification (BLS) for managing boot entries and configurations, might not function correctly in RHEL 8 and 9. If `ENABLE_BLSCFG` isn't present, the default behavior is `false`.

   This modification also ensures that all console messages are sent to the first serial port and enables interaction with the serial console, which can assist Azure support with debugging issues. This configuration also turns off the new naming conventions for network interface cards (NICs).

   ```config
   rhgb quiet crashkernel=auto
   ```

   Graphical and quiet boots aren't useful in a cloud environment where you want all the logs to be sent to the serial port. You can leave the `crashkernel` option configured if you want. This parameter reduces the amount of available memory in the VM by 128 MB or more, which might be a problem for smaller VM sizes.

1. After you're finished editing `/etc/default/grub`, run the following command to rebuild the grub configuration:

    ```bash
    sudo grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/grub2/grub.cfg
    ```

    > [!NOTE]
    > If you're uploading a UEFI-enabled VM, the command to update grub is `grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/efi/EFI/redhat/grub.cfg`.

1. Ensure that the SSH server is installed and configured to start at boot time, which is usually the default. Modify `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` to include the following line:

    ```config
    ClientAliveInterval 180
    ```

1. The WALinuxAgent package, `WALinuxAgent-<version>`, has been pushed to the Red Hat extras repository. Enable the extras repository:

    ```bash
    sudo subscription-manager repos --enable=rhel-7-server-extras-rpms
    ```

1. Install the Azure Linux agent, `cloud-init`, and other necessary utilities:

    ```bash
    sudo yum install -y WALinuxAgent cloud-init cloud-utils-growpart gdisk hyperv-daemons
    sudo systemctl enable waagent.service
    sudo systemctl enable cloud-init.service
    ```

1. Configure `cloud-init` to handle the provisioning:

    1. Configure `waagent` for `cloud-init`:

        ```bash
        sudo sed -i 's/Provisioning.Agent=auto/Provisioning.Agent=auto/g' /etc/waagent.conf
        sudo sed -i 's/ResourceDisk.Format=y/ResourceDisk.Format=n/g' /etc/waagent.conf
        sudo sed -i 's/ResourceDisk.EnableSwap=y/ResourceDisk.EnableSwap=n/g' /etc/waagent.conf
        ```
    
        > [!NOTE]
        > If you're migrating a specific VM and don't want to create a generalized image, set `Provisioning.Agent=disabled` on the `/etc/waagent.conf` configuration.
    
    1. Configure mounts:

        ```bash
        sudo echo "Adding mounts and disk_setup to init stage"
        sudo sed -i '/ - mounts/d' /etc/cloud/cloud.cfg
        sudo sed -i '/ - disk_setup/d' /etc/cloud/cloud.cfg
        sudo sed -i '/cloud_init_modules/a\\ - mounts' /etc/cloud/cloud.cfg
        sudo sed -i '/cloud_init_modules/a\\ - disk_setup' /etc/cloud/cloud.cfg
        ```

    1. Configure the Azure data source:

        ```bash
        sudo echo "Allow only Azure datasource, disable fetching network setting via IMDS"
        sudo tee /etc/cloud/cloud.cfg.d/91-azure_datasource.cfg <<EOF
        datasource_list: [ Azure ]
        datasource:
            Azure:
                apply_network_config: False
        EOF
        ```

    1. If configured, remove the existing swap file:

        ```bash
        if [[ -f /mnt/resource/swapfile ]]; then
        echo "Removing swapfile" #RHEL uses a swapfile by default
        swapoff /mnt/resource/swapfile
        rm /mnt/resource/swapfile -f
        fi
        ```

    1. Configure `cloud-init` logging:

        ```bash
        sudo echo "Add console log file"
        sudo tee <<EOF /etc/cloud/cloud.cfg.d/05_logging.cfg > /dev/null

        # This tells cloud-init to redirect its stdout and stderr to
        # 'tee -a /var/log/cloud-init-output.log' so the user can see output
        # there without needing to look on the console.
        output: {all: '| tee -a /var/log/cloud-init-output.log'}
        EOF
        ```

1. Swap configuration:
    - Don't create swap space on the operating system disk.

       Previously, the Azure Linux agent was used to automatically configure swap space by using the local resource disk that's attached to the VM after the VM is provisioned on Azure. This action is now handled by `cloud-init`. You *must not* use the Linux agent to format the resource disk to create the swap file. Modify the following parameters in `/etc/waagent.conf` appropriately:

        ```config
        ResourceDisk.Format=n
        ResourceDisk.EnableSwap=n
        ```

    - If you want to mount, format, and create the swap, you can either:
       * Pass this code in as a `cloud-init` configuration every time you create a VM through custom data. We recommend this method.
       * Use a `cloud-init` directive baked into the image that does this step every time the VM is created.

            ```bash
            sudo echo 'DefaultEnvironment="CLOUD_CFG=/etc/cloud/cloud.cfg.d/00-azure-swap.cfg"' >> /etc/systemd/system.conf
            sudo tee /etc/cloud/cloud.cfg.d/00-azure-swap.cfg <<EOF    
            #cloud-config
            # Generated by Azure cloud image build
            disk_setup:
              ephemeral0:
                table_type: mbr
                layout: [66, [33, 82]]
                overwrite: True
            fs_setup:
              - device: ephemeral0.1
                filesystem: ext4
              - device: ephemeral0.2
                filesystem: swap
            mounts:
              - ["ephemeral0.1", "/mnt/resource"]
              - ["ephemeral0.2", "none", "swap", "sw,nofail,x-systemd.requires=cloud-init.service,x-systemd.device-timeout=2", "0", "0"]
            EOF
            ```

1. Configure `cloud-init` telemetry to assist with troubleshooting for provisioning issues:

   ```bash
   sudo tee -a /etc/cloud/cloud.cfg.d/10-azure-kvp.cfg <<EOF
   # This config enables cloud-init to report provisioning telemetry to aid with troubleshooting
   Reporting:
     logging:
       type: log
     telemetry:
       type: hyperv
   EOF
   ```

1. If you want to unregister the subscription, run the following command:

    ```bash

    sudo subscription-manager unregister
     ```

1. Deprovision the VM and prepare it for provisioning on Azure:

    > [!CAUTION]
    > If you're migrating a specific VM and don't want to create a generalized image, skip the deprovision step. Running the command `waagent -force -deprovision+user` renders the source machine unusable. This step is intended only to create a generalized image.

    ```bash
    sudo rm -f /var/log/waagent.log
    sudo cloud-init clean --logs --seed
    sudo waagent -force -deprovision+user
    sudo rm -f ~/.bash_history
    sudo export HISTSIZE=0
    ```

1. Select **Action** > **Shut Down** in Hyper-V Manager. Your Linux VHD is now ready to be [uploaded to Azure](./upload-vhd.md#option-1-upload-a-vhd).



#### [RHEL 8+/9+ using Hyper-V Manager](#tab/rhel89hv)

1. In Hyper-V Manager, select the VM.

1. Select **Connect** to open a console window for the VM.

1. Ensure that the Network Manager service starts at boot time:

    ```bash
    sudo systemctl enable NetworkManager.service
    ```

1. Configure the network interface to automatically start at boot and use the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol:

    ```bash
    sudo nmcli con mod eth0 connection.autoconnect yes ipv4.method auto
    ```
    
    > [!NOTE]
    > When you use Accelerated Networking, the synthetic interface that's created must be configured to be unmanaged by using a udev rule. This action prevents `NetworkManager` from assigning the same IP to it as the primary interface. <br>
    
    To apply it:<br>
    
    ```bash
    sudo tee <<EOF /etc/udev/rules.d/68-azure-sriov-nm-unmanaged.rules > /dev/null
    # Accelerated Networking on Azure exposes a new SRIOV interface to the VM.
    # This interface is transparently bonded to the synthetic interface,
    # so NetworkManager should just ignore any SRIOV interfaces.
    SUBSYSTEM=="net", DRIVERS=="hv_pci", ACTION!="remove", ENV{NM_UNMANAGED}="1"
    EOF
    ```
1. Register your Red Hat subscription to enable the installation of packages from the RHEL repository:

    ```bash
    sudo subscription-manager register --auto-attach --username=XXX --password=XXX
    ```

1. Modify the kernel boot line in your grub configuration to include more kernel parameters for Azure and enable the serial console.

1. Remove current GRUB parameters:

    ```bash
    sudo grub2-editenv - unset kernelopts
    ```

1. Edit `/etc/default/grub` in a text editor, and add the following parameters:

    ```config-grub
    GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX="console=tty1 console=ttyS0,115200n8 earlyprintk=ttyS0,115200 earlyprintk=ttyS0 net.ifnames=0"
    GRUB_TERMINAL_OUTPUT="serial console"
    GRUB_SERIAL_COMMAND="serial --speed=115200 --unit=0 --word=8 --parity=no --stop=1"
    ```

   This modification also ensures that all console messages are sent to the first serial port and enable interaction with the serial console, which can assist Azure support with debugging issues. This configuration also turns off the new naming conventions for NICs.

1. We recommend that you also remove the following parameters:

    ```config
    rhgb quiet crashkernel=auto
    ```

    Graphical and quiet boots aren't useful in a cloud environment where you want all the logs to be sent to the serial port. You can leave the `crashkernel` option configured if you want. This parameter reduces the amount of available memory in the VM by 128 MB or more, which might be a problem for smaller VM sizes.

1. After you're finished editing `/etc/default/grub`, run the following command to rebuild the grub configuration:

    ```bash
    sudo grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/grub2/grub.cfg
    ```
    
    For a UEFI-enabled VM, run the following command:

    ```bash
    sudo grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/efi/EFI/redhat/grub.cfg
    ```

1. Ensure that the SSH server is installed and configured to start at boot time, which is usually the default. Modify `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` to include the following line:

    ```config
    ClientAliveInterval 180
    ```

1. Install the Azure Linux agent, `cloud-init`, and other necessary utilities:

    ```bash
    sudo yum install -y WALinuxAgent cloud-init cloud-utils-growpart gdisk hyperv-daemons
    sudo systemctl enable waagent.service
    sudo systemctl enable cloud-init.service
    ```

1. Configure `cloud-init` to handle the provisioning:

    1. Configure `waagent` for `cloud-init`:

        ```bash
        sudo sed -i 's/Provisioning.Agent=auto/Provisioning.Agent=cloud-init/g' /etc/waagent.conf 
        sudo sed -i 's/ResourceDisk.Format=y/ResourceDisk.Format=n/g' /etc/waagent.conf
        sudo sed -i 's/ResourceDisk.EnableSwap=y/ResourceDisk.EnableSwap=n/g' /etc/waagent.conf
        ```

        > [!NOTE]
        > If you're migrating a specific VM and don't want to create a generalized image, set `Provisioning.Agent=disabled` on the `/etc/waagent.conf` configuration.

    1. Configure mounts:

        ```bash
        sudo echo "Adding mounts and disk_setup to init stage"
        sudo sed -i '/ - mounts/d' /etc/cloud/cloud.cfg
        sudo sed -i '/ - disk_setup/d' /etc/cloud/cloud.cfg
        sudo sed -i '/cloud_init_modules/a\\ - mounts' /etc/cloud/cloud.cfg
        sudo sed -i '/cloud_init_modules/a\\ - disk_setup' /etc/cloud/cloud.cfg
        ```

    1. Configure the Azure data source:

        ```bash
        sudo echo "Allow only Azure datasource, disable fetching network setting via IMDS"
        sudo tee /etc/cloud/cloud.cfg.d/91-azure_datasource.cfg <<EOF
        datasource_list: [ Azure ]
        datasource:
            Azure:
                apply_network_config: False
        EOF
        ```

    1. If configured, remove the existing swap file:

        ```bash
        if [[ -f /mnt/resource/swapfile ]]; then
        echo "Removing swapfile" #RHEL uses a swapfile by defaul
        swapoff /mnt/resource/swapfile
        rm /mnt/resource/swapfile -f
        fi
        ```

    1. Configure `cloud-init` logging:

        ```bash
        sudo echo "Add console log file"
        sudo tee <<EOF /etc/cloud/cloud.cfg.d/05_logging.cfg > /dev/null 

        # This tells cloud-init to redirect its stdout and stderr to
        # 'tee -a /var/log/cloud-init-output.log' so the user can see output
        # there without needing to look on the console.
        output: {all: '| tee -a /var/log/cloud-init-output.log'}
        EOF
        ```

1. Swap configuration:
    - Don't create swap space on the operating system disk.

       Previously, the Azure Linux agent was used to automatically configure swap space by using the local resource disk that's attached to the VM after the VM is provisioned on Azure. This action is now handled by `cloud-init`. You *must not* use the Linux agent to format the resource disk create the swap file. Modify the following parameters in `/etc/waagent.conf` appropriately:

       ```bash
       ResourceDisk.Format=n
       ResourceDisk.EnableSwap=n
       ```

       * Pass this code in as a `cloud-init` configuration every time you create a VM through custom data. We recommend this method.
       * Use a `cloud-init` directive baked into the image that does this step every time the VM is created.

            ```bash
            sudo echo 'DefaultEnvironment="CLOUD_CFG=/etc/cloud/cloud.cfg.d/00-azure-swap.cfg"' >> /etc/systemd/system.conf
            sudo tee  /etc/cloud/cloud.cfg.d/00-azure-swap.cfg <<EOF
            #cloud-config
            # Generated by Azure cloud image build
            disk_setup:
              ephemeral0:
                table_type: mbr
                layout: [66, [33, 82]]
                overwrite: True
            fs_setup:
              - device: ephemeral0.1
                filesystem: ext4
              - device: ephemeral0.2
                filesystem: swap
            mounts:
              - ["ephemeral0.1", "/mnt/resource"]
              - ["ephemeral0.2", "none", "swap", "sw,nofail,x-systemd.device-timeout=2,x-systemd.requires=cloud-init.service", "0", "0"]
            EOF
            ```

1. Configure `cloud-init` telemetry to assist with troubleshooting for provisioning issues:

   ```bash
   sudo tee -a /etc/cloud/cloud.cfg.d/10-azure-kvp.cfg <<EOF
   # This config enables cloud-init to report provisioning telemetry to aid with troubleshooting
   Reporting:
     logging:
       type: log
     telemetry:
       type: hyperv
   EOF
   ```

1. If you want to unregister the subscription, run the following command:

    ```bash
    sudo subscription-manager unregister
    ```

1. Run the following commands to deprovision the VM and prepare it for provisioning on Azure:

    ```bash
    sudo cloud-init  clean --logs --seed
    sudo waagent -force -deprovision+user
    sudo rm -f ~/.bash_history
    sudo sudo rm -f /var/log/waagent.log
    sudo export HISTSIZE=0
    ```

    > [!CAUTION]
    > If you're migrating a specific VM and don't want to create a generalized image, skip the deprovision step. Running the command `waagent -force -deprovision+user` renders the source machine unusable. This step is intended only to create a generalized image.

1. Select **Action** > **Shut Down** in Hyper-V Manager. Your Linux VHD is now ready to be [uploaded to Azure](./upload-vhd.md#option-1-upload-a-vhd).



#### [RHEL 7 using KVM](#tab/rhel7KVM)

This section shows you how to use KVM to prepare RHEL 7 to upload to Azure.

1. Download the RHEL 7 KVM image of  from the Red Hat website.

1. Set a root password.

    Generate an encrypted password, and copy the output of the command:

    ```bash
    sudo openssl passwd -1 changeme
    ```

    Set a root password with guestfish:

    ```bash
    sudo guestfish --rw -a <image-name>
    > <fs> run
    > <fs> list-filesystems
    > <fs> mount /dev/sda1 /
    > <fs> vi /etc/shadow
    > <fs> exit
    ```

   Change the second field for the `root` user from `!!` to the encrypted password.

1. Create a VM in KVM from the qcow2 image. Set the disk type to **qcow2**, and set the virtual network interface device model to **virtio**. Then, start the VM and sign in as root.

1. Create or edit the `/etc/sysconfig/network` file, and add the following text:

    ```config
    NETWORKING=yes
    HOSTNAME=localhost.localdomain
    ```

1. Create or edit the `/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0` file, and add the following text:

    ```config
    DEVICE=eth0
    ONBOOT=yes
    BOOTPROTO=dhcp
    TYPE=Ethernet
    USERCTL=no
    PEERDNS=yes

1. Ensure that the network service starts at boot time:

    ```bash
    sudo systemctl enable network
    ```

1. Register your Red Hat subscription to enable installation of packages from the RHEL 7 repository:

    ```bash
    sudo subscription-manager register --auto-attach --username=XXX --password=XXX
    ```

1. Modify the kernel boot line in your grub configuration to include more kernel parameters for Azure. To do this configuration, open `/etc/default/grub` in a text editor and edit the `GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX` parameter. For example:

    ```config-grub
    GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX="console=ttyS0 earlyprintk=ttyS0 net.ifnames=0"
    ```

   This command also ensures that all console messages are sent to the first serial port, which can assist Azure support with debugging issues. The command also turns off the new  naming conventions for NICs. We also recommend that you remove the following parameters:

    ```config-grub
    rhgb quiet crashkernel=auto
    ```

    Graphical and quiet boots aren't useful in a cloud environment where you want all the logs to be sent to the serial port. You can leave the `crashkernel` option configured if you want. This parameter reduces the amount of available memory in the VM by 128 MB or more, which might be a problem for smaller VM sizes.

1. After you're finished editing `/etc/default/grub`, run the following command to rebuild the grub configuration:

    ```bash
    sudo grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/grub2/grub.cfg
    ```

1. Add Hyper-V modules into initramfs.

    Edit `/etc/dracut.conf` and add content:

    ```config-conf
    add_drivers+=" hv_vmbus hv_netvsc hv_storvsc "
    ```

    Rebuild initramfs:

    ```bash
    sudo dracut -f -v
    ```

1. Uninstall `cloud-init`:

    ```bash
    sudo yum remove cloud-init
    ```

1. Ensure that the SSH server is installed and configured to start at boot time:

    ```bash
    sudo systemctl enable sshd
    ```

    Modify `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` to include the following lines:

    ```config
    PasswordAuthentication yes
    ClientAliveInterval 180
    ```

1. The WALinuxAgent package, `WALinuxAgent-<version>`, has been pushed to the Red Hat extras repository. Enable the extras repository:

    ```bash
    sudo subscription-manager repos --enable=rhel-7-server-extras-rpms
    ```

1. Install the Azure Linux agent:

    ```bash
    sudo yum install WALinuxAgent
    ```

    Enable the `waagent` service:

    ```bash
    sudo systemctl enable waagent.service
    ```

1. Install `cloud-init`.
   
    Follow the steps in "Prepare a RHEL 7 VM from Hyper-V Manager," step 12, "Install `cloud-init` to handle the provisioning."

1. Swap configuration:

    - Don't create swap space on the operating system disk.
    - Follow the steps in "Prepare a  VM from Hyper-V Manager," step 13, "Swap configuration."

1. Unregister the subscription (if necessary):

    ```bash
    sudo subscription-manager unregister
    ```

1. Deprovision by following the steps in "Prepare a  VM from Hyper-V Manager," step 15, "Deprovision."

1. Shut down the VM in KVM.

1. Convert the qcow2 image to the VHD format.

    > [!NOTE]
    > There's a known bug in qemu-img versions >=2.2.1 that results in an improperly formatted VHD. The issue has been fixed in QEMU 2.6.

    >

    First convert the image to raw format:

    ```bash
    sudo qemu-img convert -f qcow2 -O raw rhel-7.4.qcow2 rhel-7.4.raw
    ```

    Make sure that the size of the raw image is aligned with 1 MB. Otherwise, round up the size to align with 1 MB:

    ```bash
    MB=$((1024*1024))
    size=$(qemu-img info -f raw --output json "rhel-7.4.raw" | \
    gawk 'match($0, /"virtual-size": ([0-9]+),/, val) {print val[1]}')
    rounded_size=$((($size/$MB + 1)*$MB))
    sudo qemu-img resize rhel-7.4.raw $rounded_size
    ```

    Convert the raw disk to a fixed-size VHD:

    ```bash
    sudo qemu-img convert -f raw -o subformat=fixed -O vpc rhel-7.4.raw rhel-7.4.vhd
    ```

    Or, with qemu version **1.6+**, include the `force_size` option:

    ```bash
    sudo qemu-img convert -f raw -o subformat=fixed,force_size -O vpc rhel-7.4.raw rhel-7.4.vhd
    ```

#### [RHEL 8+/9+ using using KVM](#tab/rhel89KVM)

1. Ensure that the Network Manager service starts at boot time:

    ```bash
    sudo systemctl enable NetworkManager.service
    ```

1. Configure the network interface to automatically start at boot and use the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol:

    ```bash
    sudo nmcli con mod eth0 connection.autoconnect yes ipv4.method auto
    ```

1. Register your Red Hat subscription to enable the installation of packages from the RHEL repository:

    ```bash
    sudo subscription-manager register --auto-attach --username=XXX --password=XXX
    ```

1. Modify the kernel boot line in your grub configuration to include more kernel parameters for Azure and enable the serial console.

1. Remove current GRUB parameters:

    ```bash
    sudo grub2-editenv - unset kernelopts
    ```

1. Edit `/etc/default/grub` in a text editor, and add the following parameters:

    ```config-grub
    GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX="console=tty1 console=ttyS0,115200n8 earlyprintk=ttyS0,115200 earlyprintk=ttyS0 net.ifnames=0"
    GRUB_TERMINAL_OUTPUT="serial console"
    GRUB_SERIAL_COMMAND="serial --speed=115200 --unit=0 --word=8 --parity=no --stop=1"
    ```

   This modification also ensures that all console messages are sent to the first serial port and enable interaction with the serial console, which can assist Azure support with debugging issues. This configuration also turns off the new naming conventions for NICs.

1. We recommend that you also remove the following parameters:

    ```config
    rhgb quiet crashkernel=auto
    ```

    Graphical and quiet boots aren't useful in a cloud environment where you want all the logs to be sent to the serial port. You can leave the `crashkernel` option configured if you want.

1. Ensure that the SSH server is installed and configured to start at boot time, which is usually the default. Modify `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` to include the following line:

    ```config
    ClientAliveInterval 180
    ```

1. Install the Azure Linux agent, `cloud-init`, and other necessary utilities:

    ```bash
    sudo yum install -y WALinuxAgent cloud-init cloud-utils-growpart gdisk hyperv-daemons
    sudo systemctl enable waagent.service
    sudo systemctl enable cloud-init.service
    ```

1. Configure `cloud-init` to handle the provisioning:

    1. Configure `waagent` for `cloud-init`:

        ```bash
        sudo sed -i 's/Provisioning.Agent=auto/Provisioning.Agent=cloud-init/g' /etc/waagent.conf
        sudo sed -i 's/ResourceDisk.Format=y/ResourceDisk.Format=n/g' /etc/waagent.conf
        sudo sed -i 's/ResourceDisk.EnableSwap=y/ResourceDisk.EnableSwap=n/g' /etc/waagent.conf
        ```

        > [!NOTE]
        > If you're migrating a specific VM and don't want to create a generalized image, set `Provisioning.Agent=disabled` on the `/etc/waagent.conf` configuration.

    1. Configure mounts:

        ```bash
        sudo echo "Adding mounts and disk_setup to init stage"
        sudo sed -i '/ - mounts/d' /etc/cloud/cloud.cfg
        sudo sed -i '/ - disk_setup/d' /etc/cloud/cloud.cfg

        >   - disk_setup
        >   - mounts 
        >   - migrators
        > ```

    1. Configure the Azure data source:

        ```bash
        sudo echo "Allow only Azure datasource, disable fetching network setting via IMDS"
        sudo tee /etc/cloud/cloud.cfg.d/91-azure_datasource.cfg <<EOF
        datasource_list: [ Azure ]
        datasource:
            Azure:
                apply_network_config: False
        EOF
        ```

    1. If configured, remove the existing swap file:

        ```bash
        if [[ -f /mnt/resource/swapfile ]]; then
        echo "Removing swapfile" #RHEL uses a swapfile by default
        swapoff /mnt/resource/swapfile
        rm /mnt/resource/swapfile -f
        fi
        ```

    1. Configure `cloud-init` logging:

        ```bash
        sudo echo "Add console log file"
        sudo tee <<EOF /etc/cloud/cloud.cfg.d/05_logging.cfg >/dev/null 

        # This tells cloud-init to redirect its stdout and stderr to
        # 'tee -a /var/log/cloud-init-output.log' so the user can see output
        # there without needing to look on the console.
        output: {all: '| tee -a /var/log/cloud-init-output.log'}
        EOF
        ```

1. Swap configuration:
    - Don't create swap space on the operating system disk.

       Previously, the Azure Linux agent was used to automatically configure swap space by using the local resource disk that's attached to the VM after the VM is provisioned on Azure. This action is now handled by `cloud-init`. You *must not* use the Linux agent to format the resource disk create the swap file. Modify the following parameters in `/etc/waagent.conf` appropriately:

       ```bash
       ResourceDisk.Format=n
       ResourceDisk.EnableSwap=n
       ```

       * Pass this code in as a `cloud-init` configuration every time you create a VM through custom data. We recommend this method.
       * Use a `cloud-init` directive baked into the image that does this step every time the VM is created.

            ```bash
            sudo echo 'DefaultEnvironment="CLOUD_CFG=/etc/cloud/cloud.cfg.d/00-azure-swap.cfg"' >> /etc/systemd/system.conf
            sudo tee /etc/cloud/cloud.cfg.d/00-azure-swap.cfg <<EOF
            #cloud-config
            # Generated by Azure cloud image build
            disk_setup:
              ephemeral0:
                table_type: mbr
                layout: [66, [33, 82]]
                overwrite: True
            fs_setup:
              - device: ephemeral0.1
                filesystem: ext4
              - device: ephemeral0.2
                filesystem: swap
            mounts:
              - ["ephemeral0.1", "/mnt/resource"]
              - ["ephemeral0.2", "none", "swap", "sw,nofail,x-systemd.device-timeout=2,x-systemd.requires=cloud-init.service", "0", "0"]
            EOF
            ```
1. Configure `cloud-init` telemetry to assist with troubleshooting for provisioning issues:

   ```bash
   sudo tee -a /etc/cloud/cloud.cfg.d/10-azure-kvp.cfg <<EOF
   # This config enables cloud-init to report provisioning telemetry to aid with troubleshooting
   Reporting:
     logging:
       type: log
     telemetry:
       type: hyperv
   EOF
   ```

1. If you want to unregister the subscription, run the following command:

    ```bash
    sudo subscription-manager unregister
    ```

1. Run the following commands to deprovision the VM and prepare it for provisioning on Azure:

    ```bash
    sudo cloud-init  clean --logs --seed
    sudo waagent -force -deprovision+user
    sudo rm -f ~/.bash_history
    sudo sudo rm -f /var/log/waagent.log
    sudo export HISTSIZE=0
    ```

    > [!CAUTION]
    > If you're migrating a specific VM and don't want to create a generalized image, skip the deprovision step. Running the command `waagent -force -deprovision+user` renders the source machine unusable. This step is intended only to create a generalized image.

1. Select **Action** > **Shut Down** in Hyper-V Manager. Your Linux VHD is now ready to be [uploaded to Azure](./upload-vhd.md#option-1-upload-a-vhd).

1. Unregister the subscription (if necessary):

    ```bash
    sudo subscription-manager unregister
    ```

1. Deprovision by following the steps in "Prepare a  VM from Hyper-V Manager," step 15, "Deprovision."

1. Shut down the VM in KVM.

    # Accelerated Networking on Azure exposes a new SRIOV interface to the VM.
    # This interface is transparently bonded to the synthetic interface,
    # so NetworkManager should just ignore any SRIOV interfaces.
    SUBSYSTEM=="net", DRIVERS=="hv_pci", ACTION!="remove", ENV{NM_UNMANAGED}="1"
    EOF
    ```
1. Register your Red Hat subscription to enable the installation of packages from the RHEL repository:

    ```bash
    sudo subscription-manager register --auto-attach --username=XXX --password=XXX
    ```

1. Modify the kernel boot line in your grub configuration to include more kernel parameters for Azure and enable the serial console.

1. Remove current GRUB parameters:

    ```bash
    sudo grub2-editenv unset kernelopts
    ```

1. Edit `/etc/default/grub` in a text editor, and add the following parameters:

    ```config-grub
    GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX="console=tty1 console=ttyS0,115200n8 earlyprintk=ttyS0,115200 earlyprintk=ttyS0 net.ifnames=0"
    GRUB_TERMINAL_OUTPUT="serial console"
    GRUB_SERIAL_COMMAND="serial --speed=115200 --unit=0 --word=8 --parity=no --stop=1"
    ```

   This modification also ensures that all console messages are sent to the first serial port and enable interaction with the serial console, which can assist Azure support with debugging issues. This configuration also turns off the new naming conventions for NICs.

1. We recommend that you also remove the following parameters:

    ```config
    rhgb quiet crashkernel=auto
    ```

    Graphical and quiet boots aren't useful in a cloud environment where you want all the logs to be sent to the serial port. You can leave the `crashkernel` option configured if you want. This parameter reduces the amount of available memory in the VM by 128 MB or more, which might be a problem for smaller VM sizes.

1. After you're finished editing `/etc/default/grub`, run the following command to rebuild the grub configuration:

    ```bash
    sudo grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/grub2/grub.cfg
    ```

1. Add Hyper-V modules into initramfs.

    Create `/etc/dracut.conf.d/azure.conf` and add content:

    ```config-conf
    add_drivers+=" hv_vmbus hv_netvsc hv_storvsc "
    ```

    Rebuild initramfs:

    ```bash
    sudo dracut -f -v
    ```

1. Ensure that the SSH server is installed and configured to start at boot time, which is usually the default. Modify `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` to include the following line:

    ```config
    ClientAliveInterval 180
    ```

1. Install the Azure Linux agent, `cloud-init`, and other necessary utilities:

    ```bash
    sudo dnf install -y WALinuxAgent cloud-init cloud-utils-growpart gdisk hyperv-daemons
    sudo systemctl enable waagent.service
    sudo systemctl enable cloud-init.service
    ```

1. Configure `cloud-init` to handle the provisioning:

    1. Configure `waagent` for `cloud-init`:

        ```bash
        sudo sed -i 's/Provisioning.Agent=auto/Provisioning.Agent=cloud-init/g' /etc/waagent.conf
        sudo sed -i 's/ResourceDisk.Format=y/ResourceDisk.Format=n/g' /etc/waagent.conf
        sudo sed -i 's/ResourceDisk.EnableSwap=y/ResourceDisk.EnableSwap=n/g' /etc/waagent.conf
        ```

        > [!NOTE]
        > If you're migrating a specific VM and don't want to create a generalized image, set `Provisioning.Agent=disabled` on the `/etc/waagent.conf` configuration.

    1. Configure mounts:

        ```bash
        sudo echo "Adding mounts and disk_setup to init stage"
        sudo sed -i '/ - mounts/d' /etc/cloud/cloud.cfg
        sudo sed -i '/ - disk_setup/d' /etc/cloud/cloud.cfg
        sudo sed -i '/cloud_init_modules/a\\  - mounts' /etc/cloud/cloud.cfg
        sudo sed -i '/cloud_init_modules/a\\  - disk_setup' /etc/cloud/cloud.cfg
        ```

        > [!NOTE]
        > The items for each section in the /etc/cloud/cloud.cfg file must use the same level
        > of indentation 
        >
        > Example of an incorrect setting:
        > ```
        > cloud_init_modules:
        >  - disk_setup
        >  - mounts 
        >   - migrators
        > ```
        > 
        > Example of a correct setting:
        > ```
        > cloud_init_modules:
        >   - disk_setup
        >   - mounts 
        >   - migrators
        > ```

    1. Configure the Azure data source:

        ```bash
        sudo echo "Allow only Azure datasource, disable fetching network setting via IMDS"
        sudo tee /etc/cloud/cloud.cfg.d/91-azure_datasource.cfg <<EOF
        datasource_list: [ Azure ]
        datasource:
            Azure:
                apply_network_config: False
        EOF
        ```

    1. If configured, remove the existing swap file:

        ```bash
        if [[ -f /mnt/resource/swapfile ]]; then
        echo "Removing swapfile" #RHEL uses a swapfile by defaul
        swapoff /mnt/resource/swapfile
        rm /mnt/resource/swapfile -f
        fi
        ```

    1. Configure `cloud-init` logging:

        ```bash
        sudo echo "Add console log file"
        sudo tee <<EOF /etc/cloud/cloud.cfg.d/05_logging.cfg > /dev/null 

        # This tells cloud-init to redirect its stdout and stderr to
        # 'tee -a /var/log/cloud-init-output.log' so the user can see output
        # there without needing to look on the console.
        output: {all: '| tee -a /var/log/cloud-init-output.log'}
        EOF
        ```

1. Swap configuration:
    - Don't create swap space on the operating system disk.

       Previously, the Azure Linux agent was used to automatically configure swap space by using the local resource disk that's attached to the VM after the VM is provisioned on Azure. This action is now handled by `cloud-init`. You *must not* use the Linux agent to format the resource disk create the swap file. Modify the following parameters in `/etc/waagent.conf` appropriately:

       ```bash
       ResourceDisk.Format=n
       ResourceDisk.EnableSwap=n
       ```

       * Pass this code in as a `cloud-init` configuration every time you create a VM through custom data. We recommend this method.
       * Use a `cloud-init` directive baked into the image that does this step every time the VM is created.

            ```bash
            sudo echo 'DefaultEnvironment="CLOUD_CFG=/etc/cloud/cloud.cfg.d/00-azure-swap.cfg"' >> /etc/systemd/system.conf
            sudo tee /etc/cloud/cloud.cfg.d/00-azure-swap.cfg <<EOF
            #cloud-config
            # Generated by Azure cloud image build
            disk_setup:
              ephemeral0:
                table_type: mbr
                layout: [66, [33, 82]]
                overwrite: True
            fs_setup:
              - device: ephemeral0.1
                filesystem: ext4
              - device: ephemeral0.2
                filesystem: swap
            mounts:
              - ["ephemeral0.1", "/mnt/resource"]
              - ["ephemeral0.2", "none", "swap", "sw,nofail,x-systemd.device-timeout=2,x-systemd.requires=cloud-init.service", "0", "0"]
            EOF
            ```
1. Configure `cloud-init` telemetry to assist with troubleshooting for provisioning issues:

   ```bash
   sudo tee -a /etc/cloud/cloud.cfg.d/10-azure-kvp.cfg <<EOF
   # This config enables cloud-init to report provisioning telemetry to aid with troubleshooting
   Reporting:
     logging:
       type: log
     telemetry:
       type: hyperv
   EOF
   ```

1. If you want to unregister the subscription, run the following command:

    ```bash
    sudo subscription-manager unregister
    ```

1. Run the following commands to deprovision the VM and prepare it for provisioning on Azure:

    ```bash
    sudo cloud-init  clean --logs --seed
    sudo waagent -force -deprovision+user
    sudo rm -f ~/.bash_history
    sudo sudo rm -f /var/log/waagent.log
    sudo export HISTSIZE=0
    ```

    > [!CAUTION]
    > If you're migrating a specific VM and don't want to create a generalized image, skip the deprovision step. Running the command `waagent -force -deprovision+user` renders the source machine unusable. This step is intended only to create a generalized image.



    Make sure that the size of the raw image is aligned with 1 MB. Otherwise, round up the size to align with 1 MB:

      First convert the image to raw format:

    ```bash
    sudo qemu-img convert -f qcow2 -O raw rhel-[version].qcow2 rhel-[version].raw
    ```

    Make sure that the size of the raw image is aligned with 1 MB. Otherwise, round up the size to align with 1 MB:

    ```bash
    MB=$((1024*1024))
    size=$(qemu-img info -f raw --output json "rhel-[version].raw" | \
    gawk 'match($0, /"virtual-size": ([0-9]+),/, val) {print val[1]}')
    rounded_size=$((($size/$MB + 1)*$MB))
    sudo qemu-img resize rhel-[version].raw $rounded_size
    ```

    or using jquery:

    ```bash
    MB=$((1024*1024))
    size=$(qemu-img info -f raw --output json "rhel-[version].raw" | jq '."virtual-size"')
    rounded_size=$((($size/$MB + 1)*$MB))
    sudo qemu-img resize -f raw rhel-[version].raw $rounded_size
    ```
    Convert the raw disk to a fixed-size VHD:

    ```bash
    sudo qemu-img convert -f raw -o subformat=fixed -O vpc rhel-[verion].raw rhel-[version].vhd
    ```

    Or, with qemu version **1.6+**, include the `force_size` option:

    ```bash
    sudo qemu-img convert -f raw -o subformat=fixed,force_size -O vpc rhel-[version].raw rhel-[version].vhd
    ```

1. Place the kickstart file where the installation system can access it.

1. In Hyper-V Manager, create a new VM. On the **Connect Virtual Hard Disk** page, select **Attach a virtual hard disk later**, and complete the **New Virtual Machine** wizard.

1. Open the VM settings:

    1. Attach a new VHD to the VM. Make sure to select **VHD Format** and **Fixed Size**.

    1. Attach the installation ISO to the DVD drive.

    1. Set the BIOS to boot from CD.

1. Start the VM. When the installation guide appears, select the **Tab** key to configure the boot options.

1. Enter `inst.ks=<the location of the kickstart file>` at the end of the boot options, and select the **Enter** key.

1. Wait for the installation to finish. When it's finished, the VM shuts down automatically. Your Linux VHD is now ready to be uploaded to Azure.

## Known issues

The following issue is known.

### The Hyper-V driver couldn't be included in the initial RAM disk when using a non-Hyper-V hypervisor

In some cases, Linux installers might not include the drivers for Hyper-V in the initial RAM disk (initrd or initramfs) unless Linux detects that it's running in a Hyper-V environment.

When you're using a different virtualization system (for example, VirtualBox or Xen) to prepare your Linux image, you might need to rebuild initrd to ensure that at least the `hv_vmbus` and `hv_storvsc` kernel modules are available on the initial RAM disk. This issue is known, at least on systems that are based on the upstream Red Hat distribution.

To resolve this issue, add Hyper-V modules to initramfs and rebuild it:

Edit `/etc/dracut.conf`, and add the following content:

```config-conf
add_drivers+=" hv_vmbus hv_netvsc hv_storvsc "
```

Rebuild initramfs:

```bash
sudo dracut -f -v
```

   
#### [RHEL 8+/9+ using Kickstart](#tab/rhel89Kickstart)

1. Place the kickstart file where the installation system can access it.

1. In Hyper-V Manager, create a new VM. On the **Connect Virtual Hard Disk** page, select **Attach a virtual hard disk later**, and complete the **New Virtual Machine** wizard.

1. Open the VM settings:

    1. Attach a new VHD to the VM. Make sure to select **VHD Format** and **Fixed Size**.

    1. Attach the installation ISO to the DVD drive.

    1. Set the BIOS to boot from CD.

1. Start the VM. When the installation guide appears, select the **Tab** key to configure the boot options.

1. Enter `inst.ks=<the location of the kickstart file>` at the end of the boot options, and select the **Enter** key.

1. Wait for the installation to finish. When it's finished, the VM shuts down automatically. Your Linux VHD is now ready to be uploaded to Azure.

## Known issues

The following issue is known.

### The Hyper-V driver couldn't be included in the initial RAM disk when using a non-Hyper-V hypervisor

In some cases, Linux installers might not include the drivers for Hyper-V in the initial RAM disk (initrd or initramfs) unless Linux detects that it's running in a Hyper-V environment.

When you're using a different virtualization system (for example, VirtualBox or Xen) to prepare your Linux image, you might need to rebuild initrd to ensure that at least the `hv_vmbus` and `hv_storvsc` kernel modules are available on the initial RAM disk. This issue is known, at least on systems that are based on the upstream Red Hat distribution.

To resolve this issue, add Hyper-V modules to initramfs and rebuild it:

Edit `/etc/dracut.conf`, and add the following content:

```config-conf
add_drivers+=" hv_vmbus hv_netvsc hv_storvsc "
```

Rebuild initramfs:

```bash
sudo dracut -f -v
```
