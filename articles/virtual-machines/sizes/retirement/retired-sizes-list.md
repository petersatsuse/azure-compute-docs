# Customer intent: As a cloud administrator, I want to review the list of retired virtual machine size series and their migration guides, so that I can ensure my systems are updated and transition to supported VM sizes before any planned retirements.

# Retired Azure VM size series

This article provides a list of all sizes that are retired or have been announced for retirement. For sizes that require it there are migration guides to help move to replacement sizes.

> [!WARNING]
> Series with *Retirement Status* listed as *Retired* are **no longer available** and can't be provisioned.

## What are retired size series?
Retired virtual machine size series are running on older hardware which is no longer supported. The hardware is with newer generations of hardware.

Series with *Retirement Status* listed as *Announced* are still available, but will be retired on the *Planned Retirement Date*. It's recommended that you plan your migration to a replacement series well before the listed retirement date.

To learn more about size series retirement, previous-gen sizes, and the retirement process, see the [size series retirement overview](./retirement-overview.md).

> [!IMPORTANT] 
> If you're currently using one of the size series listed as *Retired*, view the migration guide to switch to a replacement series as soon as possible.

*Previous-gen* size series aren't retired and still fully supported, but they have limitations similar to series that are announced for retirement. For a list of previous-gen sizes, see [previous generation Azure VM sizes](../previous-gen-sizes-list.md).
