# Customer intent: As a cloud administrator, I want to expand virtual machine disks efficiently, so that I can manage storage capacity without downtime and ensure optimal performance in my infrastructure.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This limitation doesn't apply to Premium SSD v2 or Ultra Disks.

> If a Standard HDD, Standard SSD, or Premium SSD disk is 4 TiB or less, deallocate your VM and detach the disk before you expand it beyond 4 TiB. If one of those disk types is already greater than 4 TiB, you can expand it without deallocating the VM and detaching the disk.

- Is supported only for data disks.
- Isn't supported for shared disks.
- Must be installed and use one of the following options:
    - The [latest Azure CLI](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli).
    - The [latest Azure PowerShell module](/powershell/azure/install-azure-powershell).
    - The [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).
    - An Azure Resource Manager template with an API version that's `2021-04-01` or newer.
- Isn't available on some classic VMs. Use [this script](#expand-without-downtime-classic-vm-sku-support) to get a list of classic VM products that support expanding without downtime.

### Expand with Ultra Disks and Premium SSD v2

Expanding Ultra Disks and Premium SSD v2 disks without downtime has the following additional limitations:

- You can't expand a disk while a [background copy](../scripts/create-managed-disk-from-snapshot.md#performance-impact---background-copy-process) of data is also occurring on that disk. An example is when a disk is being backfilled from [snapshots](/azure/virtual-machines/disks-incremental-snapshots?tabs=azure-cli).

You can expand Ultra Disks and Premium SSD v2 disks attached to VMs using NVMe controllers without downtime in all regions that support either of those disk types, except the following: 

- US East 2
- US South Central
  
Use either the Azure CLI or the Azure PowerShell module to make the change.

Allow up to 10 minutes for the correct size to be reflected in Windows VMs and Linux VMs. For Linux VMs, you must perform a [Linux rescan function](/azure/virtual-machines/linux/expand-disks?tabs=ubuntu#detecting-a-changed-disk-size). For a Windows VM that doesn't have a workload, you must perform a [Windows rescan function](/windows-hardware/drivers/devtest/devcon-rescan). You can rescan immediately, but if the time is within 10 minutes, you might need to rescan again to display the correct size. If a rescan doesn't work properly, you can either repeat the rescan or restart the VM to display the correct size.
