# Customer intent: "As an IT admin managing a Service Fabric environment, I want to understand the difference between the Azure PowerShell and Azure Service Fabric SDK, so that I can effectively manage resources and applications in my clusters."
---
> [!IMPORTANT]
> There are two PowerShell modules used to interact with Service Fabric. [Azure PowerShell](/powershell/azure/install-azure-powershell) is used to manage Azure resources, such as an Azure-hosted Service Fabric cluster. [Azure Service Fabric SDK](../service-fabric-get-started.md) is used to directly connect to the Service Fabric cluster (regardless of where it's hosted) and manage the cluster, applications, and services.
